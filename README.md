## Datasets for human - machine cooperation

This repository provides the information of several datasets used in the *human - machine cooperation* research. Each of those datasets consists of multiple human annotators and some (or all) of them annotate the whole datasets.

**Differences between human - machine cooperation and multi-rater learning datasets**
- A multi-rater learning dataset: an annotator just labels a **few** samples.
- A human - machine cooperation dataset: an annotator must label the **whole** dataset.

### Table of contents

The list of datasets can be found as follows:
